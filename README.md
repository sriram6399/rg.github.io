# Fashion Model Portfolio Website

A static, responsive portfolio website designed for a fashion model.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1.  Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).

## 🖼️ How to Change Photos (IMPORTANT)

This website is designed to let you easily swap out the placeholder images with your own photos.

1.  **Gather your photos**: Download the photos you want to use from Google Photos or your camera.
2.  **Rename your photos**:
    - Rename your main "Hero" (large cover image) to `hero.png` (or `.jpg`).
    - Rename your portrait image to `portrait1.png` (or `.jpg`).
    - Rename other portfolio shot to `pose2.png` (or `.jpg`).
3.  **Replace the files**:
    - Go to the `assets/images` folder in this project: `C:\Users\gutti\Documents\Ram_Marriage\assets\images`
    - Delete the existing images.
    - Paste your new images here.
    - *Note: If your images are `.jpg` instead of `.png`, you will need to update the filenames in `index.html` (e.g., change `src="assets/images/hero.png"` to `src="assets/images/hero.jpg"`).*
